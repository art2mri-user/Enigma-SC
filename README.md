**1) Running enigma2** 

Create a folder named **enigma2** somewhere in your computer and place all the files of **enigma2** inside of it just like in the [Installation Instructions](/Installation%20Instructions.md).     

To see how to create the **vertebral_labeling.simg** folder correctly, please read the [Installation Instructions](/Installation%20Instructions.md). It will only be necessary if you want to run the predictions via the [Singularity Platform](https://singularity-userdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To open the **enigma2** interface, open a terminal inside of the **enigma2** folder and type `./enigma2.sh`. Please don't forget to check if you have correctly installed all the requirements listed on [Installation Instructions](/Installation%20Instructions.md) before you run it.

**2) Prepare Folders** 

The first thing the user should do is to create a folder named **input** somewhere and place all desired .nii.gz files inside this folder so that the following steps can be performed. 

The **Prepare Folders** buttons takes all the files inside of the **input** folder, and divide them in differents subfolders into the **spine** folder which is created automatically outside of the **input** folder.  

By clicking on the **Prepare Folders button** a filedialog box will open, and then you can choose all the .nii.gz files inside of the **input** folder. After that, you are ready to segment them.  

**3) Spinal Cord Segmentation**  

By clicking on this button, the **enigma2** will run automatically the `sct_deepseg` function from the [Spinal Cord Toolbox](https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/user_section/command-line.html) over each image you selected from the previous step.  

But now, after clicking on the **Spinal Cord Segmentation** button, you will select all the folders inside the **spine** folder corresponding to the previously selected .nii.gz images. All the files generated by this step, will be placed inside of each individual folder inside of the **spine** folder.    

**4) Spinal Cord Vertebral Labeling (Automated/Manual)**  

The **Vertebral Labeling** can be performed in two ways, either by the **Automated** button or by the **Manual** button. We strongly recommend running only the **Automated** button and using the **Manual** button only for those images that show misidentification of the spinal cord levels in the masks generated by the **Automated** vertebral labeling.  

The **Automated** method will predict a segmentation mask for each .nii.gz image, using a [nnunetv2](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) model trained from our pipeline according to this [paper](). After that, a seg_labeled.nii.gz file will be created and placed inside of each correspondigly folder of each individual inside of the **spine** folder.  

By clicking on the **Automated** button, a small checkbox box will open, and you can choose between [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ou [Singularity](https://singularity-userdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) containerization platforms. If you choose **Docker**, immediately after that, you can select the folders within the **spine** folder that you want to run the **Automated** method on, and then the mask generation process will start. The Linux user password will be requested before initiating the process. If you choose **Singularity**, a filedialog box will first prompt you to select the **enigma2** folder on your computer, and after that, you can choose the folders within the **spine** folder that you want to run the Automated method on.  

For this step, it is crucial that you have a GPU available to run the predictions; the segmentation mask generation process will be significantly accelerated in this situation. If you don't have a GPU, the procedure will take longer to complete but can still be done using the CPU. Initially, the [nnunetv2](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) model predictions will automatically attempt to perform this task using the GPU. If your GPU is not available for this step, a brief notification will appear everytime a new prediction starts (for each individual you have selected) , and it will automatically switch to the CPU. To check if your GPU has been correctly installed, please check [Installation Instructions](/Installation%20Instructions.md).
